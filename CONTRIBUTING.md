# Contributing to Awesome Vibe Coding

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this list!

## Guidelines

### What to Add

We're looking for:

- **AI-powered tools** that enable building software through natural language
- **Learning resources** that help people understand vibe coding
- **Communities** where people discuss and share vibe coding projects

### Quality Standards

Before submitting, please ensure:

1. **You've personally used the tool** — Only recommend what you know
2. **It's genuinely useful** — Not just any AI tool, but ones that enable vibe coding
3. **It's actively maintained** — No abandoned projects
4. **The description explains why** — Don't just list it, explain the value

### How to Submit

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your item to the appropriate category
3. Follow the existing format:
   ```markdown
   - [Tool Name](https://example.com) - Brief description of what it does and why it's useful.
   ```
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Format Requirements

- Descriptions should be concise (one sentence)
- End descriptions with a period
- Use title case for tool names
- Keep alphabetical order within categories
- Include links to reviews where available

### What NOT to Add

- Tools that are just chat interfaces (not specifically for building)
- Abandoned or unmaintained projects
- Paywalled resources without substantial free content
- Self-promotional content without genuine value
