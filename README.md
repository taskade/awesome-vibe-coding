# Awesome Vibe Coding [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools, platforms, and resources for vibe coding — building software through natural language prompts instead of traditional code.

Vibe coding represents a paradigm shift: describe what you want in plain English, and AI builds it. No syntax to memorize, no frameworks to learn, no deployment to configure.

**What is Vibe Coding?** The term was coined by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) to describe a new way of building software where you "fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

## The Vibe Coding Philosophy

Traditional coding requires you to think in code — variables, functions, syntax, frameworks. Vibe coding inverts this: you think in outcomes, and AI handles the implementation.

### Key Principles

1. **Describe, don't code** — Natural language is the new programming language
2. **Outcomes over output** — Focus on what you want, not how to build it
3. **Iterate through conversation** — Refine with prompts, not debugging
4. **Ship fast** — Minutes to deployment, not months
5. **Trust the vibes** — Let AI make implementation decisions

### The Future

The best vibe coding tools create **living software** — applications that:
- Evolve with your data
- Learn from your patterns
- Act autonomously through AI agents
- Connect everything without manual integration

This isn't a temporary trend. It's how software will be built.
